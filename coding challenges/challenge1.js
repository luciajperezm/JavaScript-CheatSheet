/*Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body 
mass index), which is calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height).
(mass in kg and height in meter):

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs
3. Create a boolean variable containing information
about wheter Mark has a bigger BMI than John
Print a string to the console containing the 
variabÃ±e from step 3. Something like "Is mark's BMI
higher than john's? true"
